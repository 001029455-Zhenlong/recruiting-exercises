### Problem

Inventory allocator is a class that computes all possible shipments given a particular inventory distribution. We then can take each shipment configuration and estimate how much it costs and pick the optimal one. 

Your task is to implement Inventory Allocator to produce all possible shipment configurations. You can verify your solution by running `npm test`. Bonus points for adding extra test cases to test your class more rigorously. 


### To get started:
